# Frontend code test - SMHI client

Hi!

Glad to see that you made it here to our code test.

We would very much like to see how you solve problems as a developer and, as you might already suspect, we have an exercise for you!

The task is to write a client that consumes and presents data from SMHI's open API. Information about the API can be found [here](http://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/metfcst/index.html).

You're free to choose what languages and tools to use, which functions to implement, how to present data, etc. There's just a few requirements:

- The client should run in a web browser (latest version of an evergreen browser)
- The code should be easy to access. `git clone YOUR_PUBLIC_REPO`, for example.
- The project should be easy to run. Something along the lines of `npm install && npm start` or "go to this CodePen" should be sufficient.
- You should be able to talk about your decisions at a following interview.

We'll be looking at the project as a whole. The code you write is important, but so are the tools you choose, your project structure, version control strategy, etc.

The point is to give you a chance to show us what you've got, _and_ to get a chance to talk about it afterwards.

So whether you feel like showing off your CSS chops or amaze us with your deep understanding of monads, go for it!
