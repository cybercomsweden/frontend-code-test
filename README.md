# Frontend code test - Weather API

Hi!

Glad to see that you made it here to our code test.
We would very much like to see some of your code skills and, as you might already suspect, we have a challenge for you!

This API is already up and running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and we would for you to build the frontend with only one requirement:
- You web page should display weather data for at least 5 days

This is all we require of the solution!

When building the frontend we recommend using [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). If you do want to build the solution somewhere else that is alright with us. Just make sure that we are able to view your **solution** and **code** in an easy way.

We estimate that solving this should not take more than maximum **4 hours**.

Good luck, we look foward to have a look at your solution!
